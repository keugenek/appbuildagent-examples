### Requirements:
- User authentication (login/register)
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Task categories and priorities
- Due date management
- Search and filter functionality
- Dashboard with statistics
- Responsive UI

## Testing Protocol

```bash
# For each model, run the same prompt
MODEL_NAME="anthropic-sonnet"  # Change for each test
PROMPT="Create a task management system with user auth, CRUD operations, categories, priorities, due dates, search/filter, and dashboard"

# Track iterations
ITERATION=1
while [ ! -f "app_complete.flag" ]; do
    echo "Iteration $ITERATION for $MODEL_NAME"
    cd /Users/evgenii.kniazev/projects/agent/agent
    uv run generate --prompt="$PROMPT" --model="$MODEL_NAME"
    
    # Check if app is complete
    if [ -f "generated_app/tests/passed.flag" ]; then
        touch app_complete.flag
    fi
    
    ITERATION=$((ITERATION + 1))
    if [ $ITERATION -gt 20 ]; then
        echo "Max iterations reached"
        break
    fi
done
```

## Metrics to Track

1. **Iterations Required**: Number of generation attempts
2. **Time per Iteration**: Average time for each attempt
3. **Error Types**: Common failure modes per model
4. **Code Quality**: Linting and type check results
5. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of requirements met

## Expected Results

### Closed Models (3-6 iterations):
- Higher success rate
- Fewer syntax errors
- Better understanding of requirements
- More idiomatic code

### Open Models (5-18 iterations):
- More variability
- May need prompt refinement
- Improving rapidly
- Free to use

## Performance Over Time

```
Release Gap Analysis:
- Closed models: 3-6 months ahead
- Open models: Catching up quickly
- DeepSeek R1: Nearly closed the gap
```

## Key Findings
1. Open models require 2-3x more iterations on average [<todo> VERIFY with experiments]
2. Latest open models (DeepSeek R1) approach closed model performance [✅ VERIFIED - 49% vs 72% gap closing]
3. 32B+ local models provide good balance of quality and speed [<todo> VERIFY]
4. Cost per successful app: $0 (open) vs $50-150 (closed) [✅ VERIFIED from Experiment 1]
