**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Project:** App.build Agent Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document describes the systematic methodology used to fact-check, validate, and enhance a series of AI agent experiments. The approach transforms theoretical claims into verifiable, actionable research with clear validation status and specific next steps.

## Methodology Framework

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis and Planning
**Objective:** Extract and categorize all experimental claims from source material

**Steps:**
1. **Content Extraction**
   - Identify all experiments mentioned in source material
   - Extract specific claims, numbers, and assertions
   - Categorize experiments by type (cost, performance, capabilities, etc.)

2. **Task Planning**
   - Create comprehensive todo list for validation tasks
   - Prioritize high-impact claims that affect conclusions
   - Set up tracking system for validation progress

3. **Initial Assessment**
   - Identify claims that can be immediately verified vs. those requiring experiments
   - Flag obviously outdated or suspicious information
   - Note missing citations or sources

### Phase 2: Systematic Fact-Checking
**Objective:** Verify every quantitative claim with current, authoritative sources

**Validation Protocol:**
1. **Primary Source Verification**
   - Search official documentation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
   - Use current API pricing pages and technical specifications
   - Prioritize vendor documentation over third-party sources

2. **Currency Check**
   - Verify all data is from 2024-2025 timeframe
   - Flag and update outdated information
   - Note recent changes or updates to models/pricing

3. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - Compare claims across multiple authoritative sources
   - Identify discrepancies and resolve with most recent data
   - Document uncertainty where sources conflict

**Search Strategy:**
- **Specific queries:** "Claude Opus 4 pricing 2025", "SWE-bench scores January 2025"
- **Official sources priority:** Anthropic docs > community benchmarks
- **Recency filters:** Focus on 2024-2025 releases and updates
- **Benchmark validation:** Use established metrics (SWE-bench, coding leaderboards)

### Phase 3: Data Quality Enhancement
**Objective:** Transform raw information into structured, actionable data

**Enhancement Process:**
1. **Validation Status Labeling**
   - ✅ **VERIFIED:** Confirmed with authoritative source
   - ⚠️ **CORRECTED:** Updated with accurate information
   - ❓ **UNVERIFIED:** Requires experimental validation
   - <todo> **NEEDS TESTING:** Specific experiment required

2. **Source Attribution**
   - Add specific source citations for all verified claims
   - Include URLs, documentation sections, or official announcements
   - Note confidence level based on source authority

3. **Gap Identification**
   - Mark areas requiring hands-on experimentation
   - Specify exact parameters needing measurement
   - Prioritize gaps by impact on conclusions

### Phase 4: Experiment Design
**Objective:** Create specific, actionable experiments to fill data gaps

**Design Principles:**
1. **Specificity**
   - Define exact commands, parameters, and measurements
   - Specify success criteria and completion conditions
   - Include validation methods for results

2. **Reproducibility**
   - Document exact software versions and configurations
   - Provide step-by-step execution instructions
   - Include error handling and troubleshooting steps

3. **Measurability**
   - Define quantitative metrics for each test
   - Specify data collection methods
   - Plan for statistical significance where applicable

## Validation Standards

### Data Classification System
| Status | Meaning | Evidence Required | Action Needed |
|--------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| ✅ VERIFIED | Confirmed accurate | Official documentation + cross-reference | None |
| ⚠️ CORRECTED | Updated with accurate data | Official source contradiction | Update references |
| ❓ UNVERIFIED | Accuracy unknown | No authoritative source found | Experimental validation |
| <todo> EXPERIMENT | Requires testing | Theoretical claim only | Design and run test |

### Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary (Highest Authority)**
   - Official vendor documentation
   - Published research papers
   - Direct API responses

2. **Secondary (Good Authority)**
   - Established benchmarking organizations
   - Community leaderboards with methodology
   - Technical blog posts from vendors

3. **Tertiary (Supporting Evidence)**
   - Community discussions and forums
   - Third-party analysis and reviews
   - Informal benchmarks and testing

### Quality Thresholds
- **Minimum 2 sources** for any quantitative claim
- **Official source required** for pricing and specifications
- **Recent data preferred** (within 6 months for AI/ML claims)
- **Methodology transparency** for benchmark results

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Document Structure Analysis
```markdown
1. Read source material completely
2. Extract all quantitative claims
3. Identify experiment categories
4. Create initial todo list
5. Prioritize validation tasks
```

### Step 2: Systematic Verification
```markdown
For each claim:
1. Identify claim type (price, performance, capability)
2. Search for authoritative sources
3. Cross-reference multiple sources
4. Update with current data
5. Add validation status and source
6. Flag unverifiable claims for experimentation
```

### Step 3: Gap Analysis and Planning
```markdown
1. Identify all <todo> items
2. Group by experiment type
3. Define specific test procedures
4. Estimate resource requirements
5. Create execution timeline
```

### Step 4: Documentation Enhancement
```markdown
1. Add validation status to all tables
2. Include source citations
3. Create specific todo experiments
4. Update claims with current data
5. Generate validation summary
```

## Common Validation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Rapidly Changing Information
**Problem:** AI model releases and pricing change frequently  
**Solution:** 
- Focus on most recent official announcements
- Note approximate dates for claims
- Flag areas likely to change

### Challenge 2: Conflicting Sources
**Problem:** Different sources report different numbers  
**Solution:**
- Prioritize official vendor sources
- Note discrepancies in documentation
- Use most recent data when sources disagree

### Challenge 3: Theoretical vs. Practical Claims
**Problem:** Some claims cannot be verified without hands-on testing  
**Solution:**
- Clearly mark theoretical claims as <todo>
- Design specific experiments to validate
- Provide detailed testing methodology

### Challenge 4: Missing Context
**Problem:** Numbers without sufficient context or methodology  
**Solution:**
- Research methodology behind benchmarks
- Note limitations and assumptions
- Flag incomplete information
