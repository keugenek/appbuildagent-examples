## Testing Each Capability

### 1. Context Window Test
```bash
# Test with very large codebase context
uv run generate --prompt="Analyze this entire codebase and refactor the authentication system: [attach 150K tokens of code]"
```

### 2. Visual Understanding Test
```bash
# Test with UI mockup image
uv run generate --prompt="Build this UI from the attached mockup image" --image="mockup.png"
```

### 3. Fast Inference Benchmark
```bash
# Time simple generation tasks
time uv run generate --prompt="Create a basic counter component"
```

### 4. Reasoning Test
```bash
# Complex architectural decisions
uv run generate --prompt="Design a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform with 1M daily users"
```

### 5. Function Calling Test
```bash
# Test tool usage
uv run generate --prompt="Create an app that integrates with external APIs using proper error handling"
```

## Model Selection Guide

### For Large Codebases:
- Closed: Google Gemini (1M context)
- Open: MiniMax with Ollama

### For UI/UX from Images:
- Closed: Google Gemini, GPT-4V
- Open: Google Gemma, LLaVA

### For Speed:
- Closed: Google Flash, Haiku
- Open: Llama 3.2 8B, Phi-4

### For Complex Logic:
- Closed: OpenAI o3, Claude
- Open: DeepSeek R1, Qwen QwQ

## Expected Findings
- Open models now match most closed model capabilities
- Ollama provides unified interface for diverse models
- Performance gap closing rapidly (6-month lag)
- Cost advantage remains significant for open models
