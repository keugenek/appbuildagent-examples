# appbuildagent-examples
Code examples for local app.build/agent usage with local models.

The recommended local setup is based on guidance from [Mitko Vasilev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ownyourai).

See [local_inference_setup.md](local_inference_setup.md) for details on running the agent with `llama.cpp`.

Experiment ideas are listed in [experiments_plan.md](experiments_plan.md).
